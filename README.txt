WHAT IS PyPedal?

PyPedal is a Python package for pedigree analysis.  PyPedal is
a research tool for the use of the author and any others who
might be interested in its use. It was originally developed by
John B. Cole, and may be freely (re)distributed.


LICENSING

PyPedal is available under the terms of the GNU Library General
Public License.  <stolen from FLTK README>Contrary to popular
belief, it can be used in commercial software! (Even Bill Gates

DOCUMENTATION

Limited (read preliminary) documentation is available in TeX and
Postscript format in this tarball.


INSTALLING PyPedal UNDER UNIX/LINUX

In most cases you can just place the PyPedal pyp_*.py files in your
PYTHONPATH.  

You MUST have Python 2.4 (or later) installed in order to use PyPedal.
PyPedal depends on features in 2.4 that are not present in earlier versions
of Python.  You may find Python for your operating system at:
http://www.python.org/

You MUST have the NumPy extension to Python installed.  You can
obtain NumPy as well as installation instructions, at:
http://www.numpy.org/


INSTALLING PyPedal UNDER UNIX/LINUX

I have not attempted to use PyPedal in any environments other than
RedHat Linux 7 & 8 and Mandrake Linux 8 and 9.1.
