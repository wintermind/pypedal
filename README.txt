README - PyPedal Version 2.0.4
-------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS PyPedal?

PyPedal is a Python package for pedigree analysis.  PyPedal is a research tool
for the use of the author and any others who might be interested in its use. It
was originally developed by John B. Cole, and may be freely (re)distributed.

DOCUMENTATION

Limited (read preliminary) documentation is available in TeX and Postscript
format in this repository. An HTML version of the manual also may be found at:
http://pypedal.sourceforge.net/.

INSTALLING PyPedal

You should be able to use the usual setup.py installer that's included in the
download.

You must have Python 2.7 (or later) installed in order to use PyPedal. PyPedal
depends on features in 2.7 that are not present in earlier versions of Python.
You may find Python for your operating system at: http://www.python.org/.

You must have the NumPy extension to Python installed.  You can obtain NumPy as
well as installation instructions, at: http://www.numpy.org/.

I've successfully used PyPedal in various flavors of RedHat Linux (including
RHEL), Mandrake Linux, CentOS, and macOS (including Big Sur). I don't routinely
use Windows, so I'm afraid I can't be too much help there.
