                   domestic mammals (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and dogs)
                   derive from only a handful of domestication events.
                   However, each of these species shows a high level of
                   diversity at the nuclear genes of the major
                   histocompatibility complex (MHC). Through simulations

                   backcrossing with wild ancestors, either accidental or
