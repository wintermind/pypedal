\par pyp\_nrm contains several procedures for computing numerator relationship matrices and for
performing operations on those matrices.  It also contains routines for computing CoI on
large pedigrees using the recursive method of VanRaden (1992).

\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{a\_decompose(pedobj)} ⇒ matrices [\#]
]
\par Form the decomposed form of A, TDT', directly from a pedigree (after
Henderson, 1976; Thompson, 1977; Mrode, 1996).  Return D, a diagonal
matrix, and T, a lower triagular matrix such that A = TDT'.
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{pedobj}
]
A PyPedal pedigree object.
\item[Returns:
]
A diagonal matrix, D, and a lower triangular matrix, T.
\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{a\_inverse\_df(pedobj)} ⇒ matrix [\#]
]
\par Directly form the inverse of A from the pedigree file - accounts for
inbreeding - using the method of Quaas (1976).
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{pedobj}
]
A PyPedal pedigree object.
\item[Returns:
]
The inverse of the NRM, A, accounting for inbreeding.
\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{a\_inverse\_dnf(pedobj, filetag='\_a\_inverse\_dnf\_')} ⇒ matrix [\#]
]
\par Form the inverse of A directly using the method of Henderson (1976) which
does not account for inbreeding.
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{pedobj}
]
A PyPedal pedigree object.
\item[Returns:
]
The inverse of the NRM, A, not accounting for inbreeding.
\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{a\_matrix(pedobj, save=0)} ⇒ array [\#]
]
\par a\_matrix() is used to form a numerator relationship matrix from a pedigree.  DEPRECATED.
use fast\_a\_matrix() instead.
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{pedobj}
]
A PyPedal pedigree object.
\item[\textit{save}
]
Flag to indicate whether or not the relationship matrix is written to a file.
\item[Returns:
]
The NRM as a NumPy matrix.
\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{fast\_a\_matrix(pedigree, pedopts, save=0, method='dense', debug=0)} ⇒ matrix [\#]
]
\par Form a numerator relationship matrix from a pedigree.  fast\_a\_matrix() is a hacked version of a\_matrix()
modified to try and improve performance.  Lists of animal, sire, and dam IDs are formed and accessed rather
than myped as it is much faster to access a member of a simple list rather than an attribute of an object in a
list.  Further note that only the diagonal and upper off-diagonal of A are populated.  This is done to save
n(n+1) / 2 matrix writes.  For a 1000-element array, this saves 500,500 writes.
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{pedigree}
]
A PyPedal pedigree.
\item[\textit{pedopts}
]
PyPedal options.
\item[\textit{save}
]

\item[\textit{method}
]
Use dense or sparse matrix storage.
\item[\textit{debug}
]
Print NRM for debugging
\item[Returns:
]
The NRM as Numarray matrix.
\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{fast\_a\_matrix\_r(pedigree, pedopts, save=0, method='dense')} ⇒ matrix [\#]
]
\par Form a relationship matrix from a pedigree.  fast\_a\_matrix\_r() differs from fast\_a\_matrix() in that the
coefficients of relationship are corrected for the inbreeding of the parents.
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{pedobj}

\item[\textit{save}
]

\item[\textbf{form\_d\_nof(pedobj)} ⇒ matrix [\#]
]
\par Form the diagonal matrix, D, used in decomposing A and forming the direct
inverse of A.  This function does not write output to a file - if you need D in
a file, use the a\_decompose()  function.  form\_d() is a convenience function
used by other functions.  Note that inbreeding is not considered in the
formation of D.
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{pedobj}
]
A PyPedal pedigree object.
\item[Returns:

\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{inbreeding(pedobj, method='tabular', gens=0, rels=0)} ⇒ dictionary [\#]
]
\par inbreeding() is a proxy function used to dispatch pedigrees to the appropriate
function for computing CoI.  By default, small pedigrees < 10,000 animals) are
processed with the tabular method directly.  For larger pedigrees, or if requested,
the recursive method of VanRaden (1992) is used.
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{pedobj}

\item[Returns:
]
A dictionary of CoI keyed to renumbered animal IDs.
\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{inbreeding\_tabular(pedobj, gens=0, rels=0)} ⇒ dictionary [\#]
]
\par inbreeding\_tabular() computes CoI using the tabular method by calling
fast\_a\_matrix() to form the NRM directly.  In order for this routine
to return successfully requires that you are able to allocate a matrix
of floats of dimension len(myped)**2.
\begin{description}

\item[Returns:
]
A dictionary of CoI keyed to renumbered animal IDs
\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{inbreeding\_vanraden(pedobj, cleanmaps=0, gens=0, rels=0)} ⇒ dictionary [\#]
]
\par inbreeding\_vanraden() uses VanRaden's (1992) method for computing coefficients of
inbreeding in a large pedigree.  The method works as follows:
  1.  Take a large pedigree and order it from youngest animal to oldest (n, n-1, ..., 1);
  2.  Recurse through the pedigree to find all of the ancestors of that animal n;
  3.  Reorder and renumber that "subpedigree";
  4.  Compute coefficients of inbreeding for that "subpedigree" using the tabular
      method (Emik and Terrill, 1949);
  5.  Put the coefficients of inbreeding in a dictionary;
  6.  Repeat 2 - 5 for animals n-1 through 1; the process is slowest for the early
      pedigrees and fastest for the later pedigrees.
