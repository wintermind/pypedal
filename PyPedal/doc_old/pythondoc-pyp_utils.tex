\section*{The pyp\_utils Module}
\par pyp\_utils contains a set of procedures for creating and operating on PyPedal pedigrees.
This includes routines for reordering and renumbering pedigrees, as well as for modifying
pedigrees.
\subsection*{Module Contents}
\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{assign\_offspring(pedobj)} ⇒ integer [\#]
]
\par assign\_offspring() assigns offspring to their parent(s)'s unknown sex offspring list (well, dictionary).
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{myped}
]
An instance of a NewPedigree object.
\item[Returns:
]
0 for failure and 1 for success.
\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{assign\_sexes(pedobj)} ⇒ integer [\#]
]
\par assign\_sexes() assigns a sex to every animal in the pedigree using sire and daughter lists for improved accuracy.
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{pedobj}
]
A renumbered and reordered PyPedal pedigree object.
\item[Returns:
]
0 for failure and 1 for success.
\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{delete\_id\_map(filetag='\_renumbered\_')} ⇒ integer [\#]
]
\par delete\_id\_map() checks to see if an ID map for the given filetag exists.  If the file exists, it is
deleted.
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{filetag}
]
A descriptor prepended to output file names that is used to determine name of the file to delete.
\item[Returns:
]
A flag indicating whether or not the file was successfully deleted (0|1)
\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{fast\_reorder(myped, filetag='\_new\_reordered\_', io='no', debug=0)} ⇒ list [\#]
]
\par fast\_reorder() renumbers a pedigree such that parents precede their offspring in
the pedigree.  In order to minimize overhead as much as is reasonably possible,
a list of animal IDs that have already been seen is kept.  Whenever a parent
that is not in the seen list is encountered, the offspring of that parent is
moved to the end of the pedigree.  This should ensure that the pedigree is
properly sorted such that all parents precede their offspring.  myped is
reordered in place.  fast\_reorder() uses dictionaries to renumber the pedigree
based on paddedIDs.
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{myped}
]
A PyPedal pedigree object.
\item[\textit{filetag}
]
A descriptor prepended to output file names.
\item[\textit{io}
]
Indicates whether or not to write the reordered pedigree to a file (yes|no).
\item[\textit{debug}
]
Flag to indicate whether or not debugging messages are written to STDOUT.
\item[Returns:
]
A reordered PyPedal pedigree.
\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{load\_id\_map(filetag='\_renumbered\_')} ⇒ dictionary [\#]
]
\par load\_id\_map() reads an ID map from the file generated by pyp\_utils/renumber()
into a dictionary.  There is a VERY similar function, pyp\_io/id\_map\_from\_file(), that
is deprecated because it is much more fragile that this procedure.
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{filetag}
]
A descriptor prepended to output file names that is used to determine the input file name.
\item[Returns:
]
A dictionary whose keys are renumbered IDs and whose values are original IDs or an empty dictionary (on failure).
\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{pedigree\_range(pedobj, n)} ⇒ list [\#]
]
\par pedigree\_range() takes a renumbered pedigree and removes all individuals
with a renumbered ID > n.  The reduced pedigree is returned.  Assumes that
the input pedigree is sorted on animal key in ascending order.
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{myped}
]
A PyPedal pedigree object.
\item[\textit{n}
]
A renumbered animalID.
\item[Returns:
]
A pedigree containing only animals born in the given birthyear of an ampty list (on failure).
\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{pyp\_datestamp()} ⇒ string [\#]
]
\par pyp\_datestamp() returns a datestamp, as a string, of the format
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{None}
]

\item[Returns:
]
A 14-character string containing the datestamp.
\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{pyp\_nice\_time()} ⇒ string [\#]
]
\par pyp\_nice\_time() returns the current date and time formatted as, e.g.,
Wed Mar 30 10:26:31 2005.
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{None}
]

\item[Returns:
]
A string containing the formatted date and time.
\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{renumber(myped, filetag='\_renumbered\_', io='no', outformat='0', debug=0, returnmap=0, missingparent=0, animaltype='new')} ⇒ list [\#]
]
\par renumber() takes a pedigree as input and renumbers it such that the oldest
animal in the pedigree has an ID of '1' and the n-th animal has an ID of 'n'.  If the
pedigree is not ordered from oldest to youngest such that all offspring precede their
offspring, the pedigree will be reordered.  The renumbered pedigree is written to disc in
'asd' format and a map file that associates sequential IDs with original IDs is also
written.
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{myped}
]
A PyPedal pedigree object.
\item[\textit{filetag}
]
A descriptor prepended to output file names.
\item[\textit{io}

Indicates whether or not to write the renumbered pedigree to a file (yes|no).
\item[\textit{outformat}
]
Flag to indicate whether or not to write an asd pedigree (0) or a full pedigree (1).
\item[\textit{returnmap}
]
Indicates whether or not an ID map, as well as the renumbered pedigree, should be returned.  If nonzero, suppresses writing of ID maps to disc.
\item[\textit{debug}
]
Flag to indicate whether or not progress messages are written to stdout.
\item[\textit{missingparent}
]
Indicates the value used to indicate a missing parent.
\item[\textit{animaltype}
]
Type of animal object used to populate pedigree
\item[Returns:
]
A reordered PyPedal pedigree.
\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{reorder(myped, filetag='\_reordered\_', io='no', missingparent=0, debug=0, max\_rounds=100)} ⇒ list [\#]
]
\par reorder() renumbers a pedigree such that parents precede their offspring in the
pedigree.  In order to minimize overhead as much as is reasonably possible,
a list of animal IDs that have already been seen is kept.  Whenever a parent
that is not in the seen list is encountered, the offspring of that parent is
moved to the end of the pedigree.  This should ensure that the pedigree is
properly sorted such that all parents precede their offspring.  myped is
reordered in place.  reorder() is VERY slow, but I am pretty sure that it works
correctly.

\item[\textbf{set\_age(pedobj)} ⇒ integer [\#]
]
\par set\_age() Computes ages for all animals in a pedigree based on the global
BASE\_DEMOGRAPHIC\_YEAR defined in pyp\_demog.py.  If the by is unknown, the
inferred generation is used.  If the inferred generation is unknown, the
age is set to -999.
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{pedobj}
]
A PyPedal pedigree object.
\item[Returns:

\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{set\_ancestor\_flag(pedobj)} ⇒ integer [\#]

reordered and renumbered.

that are counts.
