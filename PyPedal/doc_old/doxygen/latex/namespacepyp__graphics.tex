\hyperlink{namespacepyp__graphics}{pyp\_\-graphics} contains routines for working with graphics in PyPedal, such as creating directed graphs from pedigrees using PyDot and visualizing relationship matrices using Rick Muller's spy and pcolor routines (\href{http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/}{\tt http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/}).  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
\hyperlink{namespacepyp__graphics}{pyp\_\-graphics} contains routines for working with graphics in PyPedal, such as creating directed graphs from pedigrees using PyDot and visualizing relationship matrices using Rick Muller's spy and pcolor routines (\href{http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/}{\tt http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/}). The Python Imaging Library (\href{http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/}{\tt http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/}), matplotlib (\href{http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/}{\tt http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/}), Graphviz (\href{http://www.graphviz.org/}{\tt http://www.graphviz.org/}), and pydot (\href{http://dkbza.org/pydot.html}{\tt http://dkbza.org/pydot.html}) are required by one or more routines in this module. They ARE NOT distributed with PyPedal and must be installed by the end-\/user! Note that the matplotlib functionality in PyPedal requires only the Agg backend, which means that you do not have to install GTK/PyGTK or WxWidgets/PyWxWidgets just to use PyPedal. Please consult the sites above for licensing and installation information.
