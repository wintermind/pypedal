\section*{The pyp\_metrics Module}
\par pyp\_metrics contains a set of procedures for calculating metrics on PyPedal
pedigree objects.  These metrics include coefficients of inbreeding and
relationship as well as effective founder number, effective population size,
and effective ancestor number.
\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{a\_coefficients(pedobj, a='', method='nrm')} ⇒ dictionary [\#]
]
\par a\_coefficients() writes population average coefficients of inbreeding and
relationship to a file, as well as individual animal IDs and coefficients of
inbreeding.  Some pedigrees are too large for fast\_a\_matrix() or fast\_a\_matrix\_r()
-$\,$- an array that large cannot be allocated due to memory restrictions -$\,$- and will
result in a value of -999.9 for all outputs.
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{pedobj}
]
A PyPedal pedigree object.
\item[\textit{a}
]
A numerator relationship matrix (optional).
\item[\textit{method}
]
If no relationship matrix is passed, determines which procedure should be called to build one (nrm|frm).
\item[Returns:
]
A dictionary of non-zero individual inbreeding coefficients.
\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{a\_effective\_ancestors\_definite(pedobj, a='', gen='')} ⇒ float [\#]
]
\par a\_effective\_ancestors\_definite() uses the algorithm in Appendix B of Boichard et al.
(1996) to compute the effective ancestor number for a myped pedigree.
NOTE: One problem here is that if you pass a pedigree WITHOUT generations and error
is not thrown.  You simply end up wth a list of generations that contains the default
value for Animal() objects, 0.
Boichard's algorithm requires information about the GENERATION of animals.  If you
do not provide an input pedigree with generations things may not work.  By default
the most recent generation -$\,$- the generation with the largest generation ID -$\,$- will
be used as the reference population.
\begin{description}
\item[\textit{pedobj}
]
A PyPedal pedigree object.
\item[\textit{a}
]
A numerator relationship matrix (optional).
\item[\textit{gen}
]
Generation of interest.
\item[Returns:
]
The effective ancestor number.
\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{a\_effective\_ancestors\_indefinite(pedobj, a='', gen='', n=25)} ⇒ float [\#]
]
\par a\_effective\_ancestors\_indefinite() uses the approach outlined on pages 9 and 10 of
Boichard et al. (1996) to compute approximate upper and lower bounds for f\_a.  This
is much more tractable for large pedigrees than the exact computation provided in
a\_effective\_ancestors\_definite().
NOTE: One problem here is that if you pass a pedigree WITHOUT generations and error
is not thrown.  You simply end up wth a list of generations that contains the default
value for Animal() objects, 0.
NOTE: If you pass a value of n that is greater than the actual number of ancestors in
the pedigree then strange things happen.  As a stop-gap, a\_effective\_ancestors\_indefinite()
will detect that case and replace n with the number of founders - 1.
Boichard's algorithm requires information about the GENERATION of animals.  If you
do not provide an input pedigree with generations things may not work.  By default
the most recent generation -$\,$- the generation with the largest generation ID -$\,$- will
be used as the reference population.

\end{description}\\

\item[\textbf{a\_effective\_founders\_boichard(pedobj, a='', gen='')} ⇒ float [\#]
]
\par a\_effective\_founders\_boichard() uses the algorithm in Appendix A of Boichard et al.
(1996) to compute the effective founder number for myped.  Note that results from
this function will not necessarily match those from a\_effective\_founders\_lacy().
Boichard's algorithm requires information about the GENERATION of animals.  If you
do not provide an input pedigree with generations things may not work.  By default
the most recent generation -$\,$- the generation with the largest generation ID -$\,$- will
be used as the reference population.

using the exact method of Lacy.  This version of the routine a\_effective\_founders\_lacy()
is designed to work with larger pedigrees as it forms "familywise" relationship matrices
rather than a "populationwise" relationship matrix.

decisions are made at the time of birth of the first offspring.  Average
ages are computed for each of four paths: sire-son, sire-daughter, dam-son,
and dam-daughter.  An overall mean is computed, as well.  IT IS IMPORTANT
to note that if you DO NOT provide birthyears in your pedigree file that the
returned dictionary will contain only zeroes!  This is because when no birthyear
is provided a default value (1900) is assigned to all animals in the pedigree.

birth of their offspring.  The computation is made using birth years for all
known offspring of sires and dams, which implies discrete generations.  Average
ages are computed for each of four paths: sire-son, sire-daughter, dam-son, and
dam-daughter.  An overall mean is computed, as well. IT IS IMPORTANT to note that
if you DO NOT provide birthyears in your pedigree file that the returned dictionary
will contain only zeroes!  This is because when no birthyear is provided a default
value (1900) is assigned to all animals in the pedigree.
