Note that I've removed all of the GUI components and have no plans to implement a graphical interface for Python.

A side effect of that is that the <strong>reorder()</strong> routine now moves all founders to the beginning of the pedigree. In the past, founders were guaranteed to precede their offspring, but they were not guaranteed to be guaranteed to precede other animals with known parents.

Many thanks to Matt for finding the bug in the first place and testing the fix on several machines to make sure it's working as advertised.</p>
            <p>For the technically-minded: The old algorithm was using sys.maxint in the hash, which is platform specific. It's a much larger number on 64-bit hardware (obviously). I guess that led to a better distribution of keys or something on the 64-bit machine. I've implemented a new approach using the MD5 module in the Python core library.</p></td>

Today I started working on a unit testing framework, and the unit test for a single routine (<strong>pyp_metrics/effective_founders_lacy()</strong>) found several small errors.  Some of them are a direct result of the big push to convert everything to the new object model which was called done in <b>2.0.0a17</b> and required a little backing-off in that area.  Specifically, <strong>pyp_nrm/fast_a_matrix()</strong> cannot be converted to the new model.

This feature has been gently tested, but needs a good workout to catch any lingering bugs.  Most of the work in this release went into cleaning-up code; all of the routines in PyPedal have now been updated to use the new-for-2.0.0 object model.  I also seem to recall adding a new item or two to <a href="doc/OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a>.  Note that these changes have NOT been well-tested and I did a lot of the work this morning.  Since I went to see "Revenge of the Sith" last night and only got four hours sleep there are almost certainly typos.  Of course, the distribution RPMs won't build if there are obvious errors (screwed-up tabs, etc.) so maybe I got lucky.  The big push for the next release will be some sort of testing framework, as well as adding logging functionality to most of the routines in PyPedal.</td>

Matrices are stored in a binary format as described in the Numarray documentation.  This provides the user with an easy way to store NRM for later work, such as visualization or computation of CoI/CoR.  I also added a new option, <b>missing_parent</b>, that can used to specify the value assigned to missing parents in the input pedigree file.<br /><br />The other noteworthy bit of news is that I have [finally] started working on documentation again.

            <ul>
                <li>In pyp_newclasses/NewPedigree.save() accepts an option, idformat, that specifies which animal, sire, and dam IDs are written.  The 'o' (original) option writes a pedigree with the original IDs as read from the original input pedigree file.  The 'r' (renumbered) option will write a pedigree file containing renumbered animal, sire,  and dam IDs.</li>
		<li>In pyp_newclasses/NewPedigree.save() accepts an option, outformat, that specifies how the saved pedigree is written.  The 'o' (original) option writes a pedigree with the same pedformat as the original input pedigree file; this is useful if you have computed CoI, inferred sex, and that kind of thing.  The 'l' (long) option will write a pedigree file containing all known fields in the animal object for which there is are pedigree format codes (see the file PEDIGREE_FORMAT_CODES).</li>
		<li>In pyp_newclasses/NewPedigree.__init__() the default logfile name is now self.kw['filetag'].log.</li>
		<li>Some changes were made to layout options in  pyp_graphics/draw_pedigree().  Pedigrees are now drawn landscaped on US letter-sized pages (8.5 in x 11 in) and will, in theory, be tiled across pages if they cannot fit on a single page.  This does not work as well as hoped, but I am working on it.</li>
		<li>pyp_graphics/draw_pedigree() now takes an optional parameter, gdot, that tells draw_pedigree() whether or not write the raw (dot language) representation of the pedigree to a file.  Code is written to a file named gfilename_pedigree.dot.</li>
		<li>pyp_graphics/draw_pedigree() now takes an optional parameter, gsize, that tells draw_pedigree() whether or not write the raw (dot language) representation of the pedigree to a file.</li>
		<li>pyp_graphics/draw_pedigree() now takes an optional parameter, gsize, that specifies the size of the resulting graphic: 'f' (default) produces as large a graph as necessary to accomodate the layout and 'l' produces a diagram scaled to fit on a letter-sized sheet of paper.</li>
		<li>Added a new method, save(), to pyp_newclasses/NewPedigree().  This long-overdue feature lets you easily save a pedigree after, for example, computing CoI.  It eliminates the need to perform time-consuming computations on pedigrees every time they are accessed by making it easy to store a "large format" PyPedal pedigree.</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug in pyp_newclasses/NewPedigree.preprocess() in which records for sires and dams that appear in a pedigree, but which do not have individual entries in the pedigree file, were assigned birth years of 0 when dummy records were inserted into the pedigree.  This was causing pyp_newclasses/NewAnimal.pad_id() to return a munged up paddedID that caused problems in pyp_utils/fast_reorder().  Tricky problem to find, that was.</li>
		<li>Made a small change to pyp_newclasses/NewPedigree.preprocess() so that blank lines are caught and handled correctly.  Before this fix a blank line with, say, an embedded TAB character would cause a fatal error b/c it was treated as a "regular" record.</li>

		<li>Removed references to "species" from pyp_newclasses/NewAnimal.printme() and pyp_newclasses/NewAnimal.stringme().</li>
		<li>Tweaked pyp_newclasses/NewAnimal.pad_id() so that it casts values to INTs before concatenating them.</li>
		<li>pyp_newclasses/NewPedigree.preprocess has been fixed to handle parents that do not have their own entry in the pedigree file.  They are added to the pedigree with an unknown sire and dam.</li>
		<li>Changed pyp_nrm/inbreeding() so that the output file written contains the original ID, the renumbered ID, and the CoI (in that order).</li>
		<li>Added a dictionary, "backmap", to pyp_newclasses/NewPedigree that maps renumbered IDs (keys) to original IDs (values).  It is the reverse direction of that provided by idmap.</li>
		<li>Added pyp_graphics/plot_pct_founders_by_year() to plot the frequency of founders in each birth year.  NOTE: This requires <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">matplotlib</a>.  If matplotlib is not installed/cannot be imported, a value of 0 is returned.</li>
                <li>Fixed pyp_graphics/draw_pedigree() so that it labels animals with their original IDs instead of their renumbered IDs.</li>
                <li>Fixed pyp_graphics/draw_pedigree() so that it displays the gtitle.</li>
                <li>Fixed a typo in pyp_newclasses/NewAnimal.__init__() that broke proper birthyear assignment.</li>
                <li>Added pyp_graphics/plot_founders_by_year() to write a histogram of number-of-founders by year of birth.  NOTE: This requires <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">matplotlib</a>.  If matplotlib is not installed/cannot be imported, a value of 0 is returned.</li>
                <li>Changed pyp_demog/BASE_DEMOGRAPHIC_YEAR from 1950 to 1900.  This brings it in line with the default birthyear of 1900 used in pyp_newclasses.</li>
		<li>Added pyp_demog/founders_by_year() which provides a dictionary, keyed by birthyear, of the number of founders with each birthyear.</li>

	    <td style="vertical-align: top;"><b>04/14/2005</b>: PyPedal 2.0.0a10 has been released.  There are only very minor changes in the package: disabled I18N (gettext) in <b>pyp_classes.py</b>, a <b>__version__.py</b> file was added, and a small fix was made to the MANIFEST file used to roll the distributions.  Thanks to Thomas von Hassel for reporting the gettext problem under FreeBSD.  Only one (1) method in <b>pyp_classes</b> used it anyway, so I am going to let that lie until I have some more time to work on it.</td>

            <td style="vertical-align: top;"><b>03/30/2005</b>: I uploaded PyPedal 2.0.0a9 today for your edification.  Please note that updated documentation has <b>not</b> yet been posted. The CHANGELOG (see below) is posted on the SourceForge site and is included in the distribution; it is worth a read.  A bunch of code has been refactored, and 2.0.0a10 will include a lot more code cleanups.  If you are using PyPedal right now, please take a look at <b>examples/new_lacy.py</b> for an example of how to use the new object model.  One interesting thing to note is that <b>pyp_metrics/effective_founders_lacy()</b> (a rewrite of  <b>pyp_metrics/a_effective_founders_lacy()</b> to support large pedigrees and the new object model) is "smart" enough to accept and use NewPedigree objects, while <b>pyp_metrics/a_effective_founders_lacy()</b> knows nothing about the new classes and must be handed a pedigree-as-Python-list by hand.  I am thinking about how to migrate a lot more of the old functions to the new way of doing things, and I expect that I will probably keep all of the current code in a working state and write parallel code to accomodate the Version 2 stuff.  I expect that someone will eventually point out that I should consider using multimethods to hide that from the user.  Hm.  Maybe later.<br /><br />
	    <b>CHANGELOG for PyPedal 2.0.0a9</b>
	    <ul>
		<li>pyp_io/pyp_file_header() and pyp_io/pyp_file_footer() now work.</li>
		<li>Added pyp_metrics/effective_founders_lacy(), which is a re-write of pyp_metrics/a_effective_founders_lacy() that works with the new object model.  Correctness was verified by comparing results against Table 3 in Lacy (1989) and Tables I and II in Boichard et al. (1997).  You can use examples/new_lacy.py to verify the results.</li>
		<li>Fixed a nasty bug in pyp_metrics/a_effective_ancestors_definite() that was due to an indentation screwup when moving from one editor to another.  Correctness was verified by comparing results against Tables I and II in Boichard et al. (1997).  You can use examples/new_lacy.py to verify the results.</li>
		<li>Added pyp_utils/pyp_nice_time() which returns the current date and time as a nicely-formatted string.</li>
		<li>Added pyp_metrics/descendants() and pyp_metrics/founder_descendants() to support the rewritten pyp_metrics/effective_founders_lacy() routine.</li>
		<li>Added pyp_utils/assign_offspring(), which adds offspring of an animal to that animal's 'unks' list.</li>
		<li>Stubbed pyp_io/pyp_file_header() and pyp_io/pyp_file_footer() in preparation for standardizing the output files written by PyPedal.</li>
		<li>Added pyp_graphics module.  It currently includes three functions from the <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/">ASPN Python Cookbook</a> for visualizing the sparsity and the elements of matrices.  I have also moved the draw_pedigree() function from pyp_utils to pyp_graphics.  From now on, any functions related to visualization will go in pyp_graphics.</li>
		<li>It looks like the sons and daus lists get screwed up when the pedigree is renumbered, but I think that it is a consequence of the item below.</li>
		<li>When a pedigree that needs renumbering is read, pyp_utils/preprocess() throws an exception when trying to assign sex codes because it uses the sire's and dam's original IDs as keys.  This represents fundamental breakage in the ordering of events in pedigree creation.  I have sort-of hacked around this for the moment, but the bug is still there.</li>
		<li>Added a new pedigree format code, asdgb, to pyp_utils/preprocess().</li>
		<li>Added pyp_metrics/generation_lengths_all() which computes the average generation interval in years for each of the four selection paths (sire-son, sire-daughter, dam-son, and dam-daughter) for all births of a parent's offspring.</li>
		<li>Added pyp_utils/assign_sexes() which iterates over a renumbered PyPedal pedigree to update sexes of sires and dams based on knowledge of their sons and daughters.  This seems to catch cases that are missed in pyp_utils/preprocess(), which needs to e cleaned up.</li>
		<li>Upon further examination, it seems like males and females are being correctly assigned.  Hm...OK.  Fixed a bug in pyp_utils/preprocess() that incorrectly assigned sires and dams with unknown parents to the sons and daus lists of the last animal in the pedigree.  This was fixed by casting to an INT before a comparison with 0.</li>
		<li>See examples/generations.py -- sons and daughters are not being correctly assigned to foo.sons and foo.daus.</li>
		<li>Need to fix a bug in pyp_utils/new_preprocesss() in which unknown sires and dams (animals with IDs of 0) were being put into male, female, son, and daughter lists.</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug in pyp_utils/preprocesss() in which unknown sires and dams (animals with IDs of 0) were being put into male, female, son, and daughter lists.</li>
		<li>Added pyp_metrics/generation_lengths() which computes the average generation interval in years for each of the four selection paths (sire-son, sire-daughter, dam-son, and dam-daughter) for the oldest (first-born) of parents.</li>
		<li>Added pyp_metrics/num_traced_gens(), pyp_metrics/num_equiv_gens(), and pyp_metrics/pyp_partial_inbreeding().</li>
		<li>Lots of code cleanup in pyp_classes.  Removed pad_id() and renamed pad_id_new() to pad_id().</li>
		<li>Removed the originalID and species attributes from the Animal() class.</li>

I have been trying to be a good programmer and use CVS to track the codebase.  Well, no more.  When I opened <b>pyp_newclasses.py</b> this afternoon for a little bit of light hacking (after refreshing my local tree from the CVS server) I found all kinds of <b>diff</b>-looking stuff in the file.  I have had all I can stand of CVS, thank you very much.  I will stick with the boring but tried-and-true method of syncing my tree between machines by way of my trusty USB stick.  I think that perhaps the complexity of CVS, with which I am not comfortable, is just not worthwhile on a relatively small project such as PyPedal.

            <td style="vertical-align: top;"><b>12/01/2004</b>: I suppose that this is my periodic reminder that PyPedal is not dead and it is not abandonware.  However, I have not had any time lately to work on the project.  I did a little profiling this morning and discovered that PyPedal requires a minimum of <b>717</b> bytes per animal record in a pedigree (!!!).  This is not really a big deal for a few hundred animals, but it is a big deal for 100,000 animals.  Back at the end of August I decided to add a bunch of new things, such as refactored classes and I18N support.  I think that I am going to have to back off of some of those changes in order to focus on more important (to me) performance issues.

I have started on a German translation, but since I do not actually speak German it is based on Babelfish translations.  I do not yet know if that is good or bad.  :-)

            <td style="vertical-align: top;"><b>08/30/2004</b>: Lots of big changes are in the works for PyPedal.  Today I started working on the new class structure that will see the introduction of a <i>real</i> pedigree class with most of the computational routines as methods.  I also started tinkering with some custom exceptions for PyPedal but I think that's not a very productive way to spend my time.  Although I have not started coding on it, I am thinking about what needs to be done to enable translations in PyPedal.  I have a few ideas here and they make their way into Alpha 8.  One thing that <i>must</i> be done before I can make a Beta release is to write some unit tests.  The <b>examples</b> subdirectory is a mess and if I write some tests it will force me to clean that up.  I hope that unit testing does not reveal a bunch of unknown bugs.  :-)<br /><br />
	    I am adding a configuration file that can be used to control the default options used by a lot of PyPedal procedures.  The idea here is to reduce the number of parameters that have to get passed around by the user.  At the moment, though, it is unclear to me how best to use the config file (thank Bob for the OptionsParser module).  I am adding <b>**kw</b> argument handling to the classes and methods, too.<br /><br />
	    One of the hard things about this part of development is to stay focused on the little details that need attention.  It is much more interesting to add new features than to perfect older ones.  For example, there is still a nasty little bug in the new pedigree format code handling procedure that affects all columns following allelotypes in an input file.  It should not be very hard to fix, but still, boring.  :-)<br /><br />
	    Anyway, what does this mean for the release schedule?  In short, I do not know.  I will probably keep releasing Alpha versions until I am happy with everything.  This will probably take until at least Christmas.  We are looking for a new place to live and I need to get at least two manuscripts written and submitted by then, so PyPedal is not first on my list of priorities.  Once unit tests and a basic GUI are completed I will start the Beta series of releases.  If I can recruit some people to bug-check then the Beta cycle may be relatively short.  Once the system is pretty well debugged I will freeze the codebase and start working on the documentation.  When there is documentation that is actually useful and I have not found any bugs that slipped through the testers I will release PyPedal 2.0.0.<br /><br />
